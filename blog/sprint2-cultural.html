      <h2>Long-term goal</h2>

      <p>To establish a set of skills in a growing industry that will allow me to work for myself.
      <br>
      The goal is to understand the programming industry, then work for a start up company, and eventually start my own company in this field.
    Within 5 years I would like to work from home, but set up an office in Auckland where I can meet clients and hold staff meetings.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h2>Personal skills I would like to see developed</h2>

      <p>Patience with myself, take my time to fully understand. Don’t rush into the next task.
      Also, I would like to work on my emotional intelligence.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>My own strengths and limitations</h2>

      <p>One of my strengths of happily getting things done can be a limitation as I struggle to be patient due to me wanting to move on to the next task.
      As nice as it is having a skill to improvise as I go, it may not be that helpful in this course, as having a plan to follow is one of the problem solving strategies. 
      However, improvising may be quite helpful if one of the problem solving strategy involves searching for new ideas.
      One of my strength of being able to make decisions quickly based on logic will be helpful in my learning journey as I will be less likely to make emotional decisions which I later may regret.
      <br>
      Bootcamp challenges will be learning at a fast face with another person next to me. I worry either I or the other person may be too slow to understand. 
      I hope we dont hold each other back in any way and are patient with one another.
      <br>
      I hope to develop skills in bootcamp such as being able to reflect on my progress, being more self aware and to develop leadership skills.
      It is important for me to graduate this course, to learn to code and to complete all of the technical aspects.

    </p>

      <div>
        <h2>My Commitment</h2>

      <p>Foundations: To move swiftly towards the next task once I understand the previous one fully. I will achieve this by doing the stretch exercises if I finish early.

      <br>
      To have a plan to follow when it comes to solving a problem. I will achieve this by referring back to the newly introduced process of solving a problem – this is saved on my desktop.

      <br>
      To work on one problem at a time. Take my time. I will achieve this by not getting behind in my work, and by taking regular breaks.

      <br>
      If I am stuck on a problem for longer than 30 minutes, I will seek help through getting in touch with my course facilitator and members of my team either through Slack or by direct conversation in class.

      <br>
      Bootcamp: I will manage my time well by arriving on time and being fully present when I am there. If I start to get frustrated I will take a five minute break, or go for a walk.
      I will be more patient with myself and others. I will listen to all of the advice offered and I will try to do my best in all expected areas.
    </p>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h2>My Expectations</h2>

      <p>Foundatins: I expect the facilitation team to be able to answer all of my technical questions, unless the question is not relevant to the course work.
      I also expect them to be able to provide the answer within a reasonably time frame. For example, within an hour or two Mon-Fri.
      <br>
      Bootcamp expectations: To be able to find one on one help when I really need it. If I get stuck on an issue, I will ask some one from my cohort (once the internet search has failed). If I cannot find answers there, I will ask a fascilitator.
      At the end of each day, I will do an hour or two of coding every weekday in the evening after dinner, as well as four to six hours in the weekend.
      <br>
      Expectations from myself: To be fully present in the work and not get distracted. To follow all of the advice such as meditation and do the yoga as prescribed for better health of mind.
