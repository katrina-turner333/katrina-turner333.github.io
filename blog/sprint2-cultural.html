      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

      <div>
        <h2>Long-term goal</h2>

      <p>To establish a set of skills that will allow me to work for my-self.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Personal skills I would like to see developed</h2>

      <p>Patience, take my time to fully understand. Don’t rush into the next task.</p>
    </div>

      <div>
        <h2>My own strengths and limitations<h2>

      <p>One of my strengths of happily getting things done can be a limitation as I struggle to be patient due to me wanting to move on to the next task.
      As nice as it is having a skill to improvise as I go, it may not be that helpful in this course, as having a plan to follow is one of the problem solving strategies. However, improvising may be quite helpful if one of the problem solving strategy involves searching for new ideas.
      One of my strength of being able to make decisions quickly based on logic will be helpful in my learning journey as I will be less likely to make emotional decisions which I later may regret.
      <p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>My Commitment</h2>

      <p>To move swiftly towards the next task once I understand the previous one fully. I will achieve this by doing the stretch exercises if I finish early.

      To have a plan to follow when it comes to solving a problem. I will achieve this by referring back to the newly introduced process of solving a problem – this is saved on my desktop.

      To work on one problem at a time. Take my time. I will achieve this by not getting behind in my work, and by taking regular breaks.

      If I am stuck on a problem for longer than 30 minutes, I will seek help through getting in touch with my course facilitator and members of my team either through Slack or by direct conversation in class.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>My Expectations</h2>

      <p>I expect the facilitation team to be able to answer all of my technical questions, unless the question is not relevant to the course work.
      I also expect them to be able to provide the answer within a reasonably time frame. For example, within an hour or two Mon-Fri.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Block-out times<h2>

      <p>As soon as Bootcamp starts, I will have other commitments 5pm onwards Mon-Friday as well as on most weekends.
      However, during foundations my time is flexible. I will be away on holiday from the 19th-25th July, meaning I will be doing extra study upfront before I leave in the evenings and weekends.
