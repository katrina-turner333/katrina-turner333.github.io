<h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
<div>
<p>Growth mindset is a different way of learning.
  Having a mindset of not yet as opposed to now, greatly influences personal performance.
  If you expect to receive something now you will feel as if your intelligence is up for judgement.
  If you fail, you will not be motivated to put effort into learning something slowly.
It is relevant for this course because of Dev Academy’s way of learning and because many students have never done programming before – it will be difficult.
 Therefore, to deal with difficulty you need to have a not yet mindset, a mindset of growth, progress and effort.
 As opposed to a mindset of having talent or intelligence.

   Something made sense to me in this exploration, to do with my own personal experience with mathematics.
   I was surprised actually.
All of my life due to an early childhood experience I believed I struggled with math, and therefore would always avoid it whenever I could.
However, when I went to university, I had to take papers that had deep algebra in them.
I put in the effort, hours and hours of slow process learning, and I ended up in the top 2% of my class.
This came as a big surprise and challenged the poor belief I had about my intelligence.
This was due to a growth mindset.

<div><p>
  I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by practicing patience, following a process and feeling grateful for every single bit of effort I put in this.

<h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
<div><p>
  Understanding the principals of neuroplasticity benefits people as it gives them a new way of learning, and thus helps do away with self-limiting beliefs about learning.
  Our brain is not a fixed, limited matter. It is instead capable of learning new things no matter what age you are.
The more you practice new things the more new electrochemical pathways are formed, making practice permanent.
</p>

<div><p>I can increase my neuroplasticity by practicing imagination, repetition as well interlinking concepts:
I can find relationships between concepts to help strengthen my learning process.
That is to say, if I form a relationship between one of my existing experiences with a new concept that I want to learn, I can help my brain learn and remember the new concept.
