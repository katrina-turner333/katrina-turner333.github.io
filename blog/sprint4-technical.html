<h1>My Approach to Problem Solving</h1>
<h2>A time I got blocked on a simple problem and how I solved it in an elegant way</h2>
<div>
<p>At my old job I would frequently come up against problems that required technical solutions.
  or example, finding a way to measure our website RAM without going to the current web host.
Unfortunately, I was most of the time unable to ask for a persons’ assistance.
In this case I would research the internet for what the problem is, and for solutions to that problem.
I felt like I was learning as I went. I found it interesting.
I would then find a step by step list to follow that would enable me to solve this problem.
I learned to take more initiative, as the internet is an array of knowledge if you know how to perform a good search.

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
 <div><p>
   This is a made-up programming language. Design language.
   You cannot compile it as the computer doesn’t understand it but it helps us explore how we should design our programs.
The longer you will spend designing the less time you will spend programming.
 Whereas if you spend a short time designing you will need to spend a much longer time working out how to build
 the program successfully.

<h3>Using Pseudocode</h3>
<p>
  First thing we need to do is decide on the name of the program, if required using camel case (CamelCase).
<br>
In PseudoCode mention you are starting a program like this:
‘PROGRAM CalculateInterest:’
<br>
Always finish your program with the word ‘END.’
<br>
<br>
I feel confident in using this strategy, but have not yet adopted the process for frequent use.
I have found other methods more helpful.

<br>

<h2>Trying something</h2>
<div><p>
  This is something I had done in the past and thus comes naturally to me.
  I like to try out many different varieties of potential solutions.
  If you don’t try, you will not know for sure.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
<div><p>
  AKA - Talking your problems out.

Software engineering term. As a programmer you are too close to your code and if you run into an issue you are too close to it to solve the issue.
You could however explain what it is supposed to do, and what it is currently doing now.
This practice usually helps resolve discrepancies and helps bring issues to light.
Helping by explaining the difference between the two.
<br>
Programmers learn that they can explain their code to anon programmer and get just the same insights as if they were talking to a non coder.
That’s where the process of talking to a duck came to life.
<br>
<br>
This is my second favorite way to understand and solve problems.
I would feel I understand my issue more once I’ve talked about it.

</p></div>

<h2>Reading error messages</h2>
<div><p>
  Not that helpful when you have a serious problem.
  But I guess it’s helpful for smaller problems.

</p></div>

<h2>Console.logging</h2>
<div><p>
I haven’t given this method enough of a try to successfully comment on it’s usefulness.

</p></div>

<h2>Googling</h2>
<div><p>
My first preferred method of finding solutions to problems.
90% of the time when I really apply myself to googling solutions, I usually find the answer.

</p></div>

<h2>Asking peers and/or coaches for help</h2>
<div><p>
I really like this method if it was in person. Online I feel I am still getting used to it.

</p></div>

<h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
<div><p>
I don’t feel reflection helps me understand coding better.
However, seems as though it’s more of a psychotherapy analysis which helps me understand my thought process better by checking in with myself.
