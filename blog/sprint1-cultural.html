    <h2>Identity</h2>

    <p>At this point, I am self motivated to achieve my goal of working for myself. The goal is to work less for more money, so I have the free time and money to do the things I enjoy. Hence, I am working on the skills to be able to achieve this.
        I feel grateful for the opportunity to realize this goal with the help of the Dev Academy.

      I like getting things done, I am always willing to plunge right into things and make decisions quickly before happily moving on to the next thing.
      I have a talent for improvising and creating things as I go as opposed to having a direct plan to follow.
      I tend to make decisions based on facts and logic which in turn can hurt other people as I struggle acknowledging or relating to their feelings. I need to master the art of following through on my ideas after I have started them.

    <h2>Values</h2>

    <p>I value being able to continuously up skill myself. In the last two years I have completed a Business Diploma and have received valuable working experience in a totally fresh field. I usually always gain some sort of new knowledge /eye opening experience each year.

      I value a balanced life. I am a bit of an adrenalin junkie, but I am trying to change this so I have a more balanced approach to life. The reason I want to be more balanced is because I am aware that I get bored too easily, have a short attention span and therefore struggle to invest in long term successes. This belief is evident from my parents opinion of me.

      I value life experience. I feel like I have really lived and learned. That is to say, I have had experiences that I will never forget and have used to shape my values. For example, when I was 15 I went to Africa on a mission trip to help in the orphanages and schools. An experience like that helped me see that people who have absolutely nothing of what we have in the western world, are actually much happier, much more fulfilled than we are. They have an unexplainable, contagious, joy-like nature. This made me see that it isn’t what we have, where we live, what we wear etc that makes us happy, it is the experiences we share and the relationships we build that creates the joyous existence.

      I have also had experiences that were dreadful. I made mistakes and I paid the price. Each experience I have had I have learned from. And if I haven’t, then I will repeat it until I learn from it, life goes on. This belief is evident from my husband’s opinion of me.

      I value beauty. Spending my summers with my grandad in a Russian village, he showed me how to see the beauty in nature and my surroundings. This skill that he taught me enables me to have an eye for beautiful things and appreciate and value nature and beauty.

    <h2>Strengths/Limitations</h2>

    <p>My experience in Tanzania of not giving my sunglasses to the boy showed me one of my limitations at the time. The limitation was being too selfish and short-sighted, and not being able to step into his shoes and look at those sunglasses through his eyes and how much they meant to him.
      One of my strengths of happily getting things done can be a limitation as I struggle to be patient due to me wanting to move on to the next task.

      As nice as it is having a skill to improvise as I go, I don’t believe this will be that helpful in this course, as having a plan to follow is one of the problem solving strategies.

      I am good at making decisions based on solely fact and logic, which in turn may be quite limiting if I have to make a decision regarding an emotional situation with a co-worker. I struggle relating to other peoples sad feelings from my heart. I usually understand how they feel from a purely logical perspective.

      One of my strength of being able to make decisions quickly based on logic will be helpful in my learning journey as I will be less likely to make emotional decisions which I later may regret. This strength may intersect with my learning obstacle because I may not have enough patience required to solve a problem, without wanting to quickly move on to the next.

      Recently, I asked someone in my co-hort to merge and delete my branch as per the assignment request in sprint 1, and in return I would do theirs. I ended up doing theirs, but they actually closed mine and I had to figure out how to fix it. This annoyed me as it made me feel suspicious of their intentions (maybe they did this on purpose to put me behind….?). This came up as my first immediate worry – but I didn’t focus on it too much. Later I felt frustrated at their lack of competence and how I had to repeat the task again. However, instead of reacting to them negatively I went back and did what I had to do to fix it. Then I asked them to try again. Finally, it worked. I said thank you with a smily face and left it at that. I believe this was an effective way of dealing with conflict like this, as sometimes I can be off in my intuition regarding someone’s intentions. It could have been a genuine mistake, so therefore I didn’t react and in the end felt grateful I had to re do some of the task as it helped me practice what I learned.
