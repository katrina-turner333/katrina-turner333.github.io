<h2>Difference between HTML and CSS</h2>
<div>
<p>In simple, non technical terms, you can think of HTML as the structure for a house.
  CSS on the other hand is the interior/exterior designer who comes to make your house look pretty.
HTML is the builder, CSS is the artist.
In the world of web design, HTML is responsible for dictating the content and structure of a webpage.
CSS is responsible for modifying the design and display of HTML elements.
Together, they produce a complete webpage interface.
<br>
<br>
To be more detailed, please refer to the below infographic.

<h2>Control Flow</h2>
<div>
  <p>In computer programming there is something called Control Flow.
    <br>
Control Flow is a way to tell the execution how the program should run and jump from one section to another.
CF refers to the order of execution of the flow. <br>
For example, if you’re running a JavaScript code on a browser, the compiler will reach a point in accord that says if this is true, do something else.
Or at some point it can be told to do something x number of times, before you move on to the next order of execution.
It just refers to the order of execution of the code.
How the program jumps form one section to another.
<br>
<br>

Control flow can be thought of as doing things in the best possible order in order to get the desired result.
<br>

For example, in life, the natural flow is to usually first go to school in order to go to university or to get a job.
Our society follows this flow in order to achieve the desired outcome of either university or job.
It would be too difficult for us to go to univeristy if we never went to school etc.
Thats an example of control flow. We control the way we achieve things in life.
<br>
<br>
Loops are an example of Control Flow. See details below.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Loops</h2>
<div>
  <p>Sometimes we want to repeat an action a number of times.
    In Javascript we have various kind of Loops.
All of these loops essentially do the same thing; they repeat an action a given number of times.
We have For Loops, While Loops and Do…While Loops, For in loops and For of loops.
<br>
However, they do have subtle differences when it comes to their output of operation.
For a detailed explanation of loops please see the below video:

<h2>DOM</h2>
<div>
  <p>DOM is an acronym that stands for Document Object Model, AKA ‘application programming interface’.
What this actually means is we can use the DOM to interact with webpages.
<br>
<br>

We can do things like add or remove content from an HTML document, can change content etc.
This and more can be done through the DOM, very easily while your web page is being loaded in a web browser.
<br>
<br>
Here is an example of how you would interact with it:
<br>
1.	Go to any website using Google Chrome, right click to button Inspect, open up the developer tools to access the DOM.
<br>
2.	Next, in the contents area of the DOM, change the content text. Now you can straight away see the changes on the website.
<br>
However, this is not going to be permanent, but it is a cool trick to show your friends.

<h2>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    What makes an array are these square brackets: [ ] . They are just a set of data.
<br>
<br>
For example,
<br>
var arr= [1,true,0] <br>

Inside an arrays you can put anything, such as a string, a number,, bullion, or another array.
<br>
<br>
Objects however use curly brackets: {} and have keys and properties.<br>
<br>
For example: <br>
Var obj= { <br>

“name”: “Nute”, <br>
“drink”: “Coke” <br>
};<br>
<br>
The above strings (another name for words in JavaScript code) “name” and “drink” are referred to as key values. They are on the left side.
The above strings “Nute” and “Coke” are referred to as property values. They are on the right side.
This is referred to as Javascript Object Notation (JSON).
</p>

<h3>Accessing Data</h3>
<br>
<p>
Arrays use a number, an index value to access an array item.
<br>
<br>
For example;
<br>
var students = [“Anne”, “Ben”, “Helena”]; <br>

alert( students[0] );
<br>
<br>
The above code will allow you to access the 0, which in an array stands for the first property. This one will access “Anne”.

Objects use a key to access their properties.

<br>
<br>
For example;
<br>
var person = { <br>
name: “Ben”, <br>
age: 23 <br>
}; <br>
alert( person[‘name’]);
 <br>
<br>
This will show you the name “Ben”.
</p>
</div>
<h2>Functions and why they are useful</h2>
<div>
<p>In JavaScript functions are one of the fundamental building blocks.
It is a procedure, a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.
Functions are a special type of object.

To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope (section of coding page that has the applicable code) from which you wish to call it (use it).
<br>
<br>
Here is an example of a simple function called square:
<br>
function square(number) {
<br>  return number * number;
<br> }
<br>
<br>
The function square takes one parameter, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself.
