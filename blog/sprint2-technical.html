      On your website you want to be able to have a little bit of space happening to let your eye rest. 
      Our eye loves space/open spaces. 
      The space allows the viewers eyes and mind to rest before comfortably moving on to the next bit of content.

     Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.

     While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
